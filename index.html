            My name is Alexander Hoffman and I am in my final year at UMKC. I've
            been programming for a couple of years and have been around
            computers almost my whole life. I currently work at MIDE as an
            undergrad researcher and help them with programming task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through both my school and work experience, I've learned many
            languages including C++, Java, Python, and Typescript. I also have
            some experience in HTML and CSS.
